My past work includes digesting the data and output the insights to a user-friendly dashboard, created using Python and SQL. 
I am currently enrolled in the course Applied Machine Learning, which enables me to further understand the intricacies of ML algorithms.
It also enables me to write production-level code for Machine Learning. 
Another course, titled Elements of AI, is a challenging course, which explores the probabilistic aspects of AI including Bayesian networks and Hidden Markov models.
