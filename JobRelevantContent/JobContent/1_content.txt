My current coursework includes a subject titled "Applied Machine Learning." It involves being able to write production-ready code with robust pipelines. Another course titled "Elements of AI" involves advanced data structures and probabilistic models. Also, during my undergraduate studies, I have taken up a project in the field of Natural Language processing.
