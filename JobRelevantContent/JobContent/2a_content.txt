I find natural language quite fascinating, since it is complicated for machines to understand, but our human brain parses it quite intuitively. 
My past work includes projects in Natural Language Processing. As a result, I am familiar with NLP pre-processing techniques, knowledge representation and prediction using machine learning.

I am currently enrolled in the course Applied Machine Learning, which enables me to further understand the intricacies of ML algorithms.
Another course, titled Elements of AI, is a challenging course, which explores the probabilistic aspects of AI including Bayesian networks and Hidden Markov models. 

During my full-time job as a full-stack developer at Accenture, I was introduced to working in a fast-paced, collaborative environment. 
As a result, I am well-versed in MEAN/MERN stack application development and collaborative methods and enterprise tools such as GitHub, JIRA etc. 

To summarize all of the above, I believe my abilities in application development as well as Machine Learning enables me to deploy machine learning applications into production.
