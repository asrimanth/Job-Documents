<<COMPANY>> is an amazing initiative to analyze audio and speech data. 
I find natural language quite fascinating, since it is complicated for machines to understand, but our human brain parses it quite intuitively. 
My past work includes projects in Natural Language Processing. As a result, I am familiar with NLP pre-processing techniques, knowledge representation and prediction using machine learning.
For example, I have previously implemented, Stemming, Tokenization, cosine similarity, logistic regression etc. just to name a few. 
I believe these are related to the project Subjective Speech Assessment Prediction, which I found quite interesting. 
I am currently enrolled in the course Applied Machine Learning, which enables me to further understand the intricacies of ML algorithms.
I would love to contribute to <<COMPANY>>, especially in the Machine Learning aspect of the project.
