% % Data Analyst
% \lettercontent{I would love to work as an analyst by making complex SQL queries, digesting all of the information, and creating human readable reports and dashboards. I do have previous experience as an intern at Sentritrec Software Solutions in data analysis. My previous work included making user-friendly reports from jargon-heavy data. To achieve my goals, I worked with Python using the web framework Dash by Plotly. I picked up some ETL skills from my undergrad in Informatica. I am skilled at using Microsoft Excel’s formulae, graphs and pivot tables. I have a solid foundation in Object oriented programming from my undergrad projects.
% }

\lettercontent{My past work includes digesting the data and output the insights to a user-friendly dashboard, created using Python and SQL. 
I am currently enrolled in the course Applied Machine Learning, which enables me to further understand the intricacies of ML algorithms. 
I have also worked with AWS before, where I ran a parse server for a simple social media clone application. 
My interest in Cloudflare began when I found out that Cloudflare uses lava lamps for seed selection in Pseudo Random Number generators, which is amazing, considering the fact that 10 percent of internet traffic is handled by Cloudflare. 
I would love to work at Cloudflare and use my abilities at the fullest to help make internet a better place. }


% Mentoring / TA
% \lettercontent{My past work also includes being the technical head of ECA club - a technical club for CS students - where I communicated extensively with my fellow juniors and taught Android App Development using Java.}


% Conclude your application letter by thanking the employer for considering you for the position. 


\lettercontent{ I think this position looks both fun and challenging — and a place for me to further my career! If you have a moment, I would love to ask you more questions about the tools you are using and the types of projects I might be running if hired. I would like to thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing more about Cloudflare and the details of the Data Science - Intern position.}
